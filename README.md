While deploying:
Change mongodb ip connection from only the server ip
Change google provider authentication to the server ip
Have edit, create login logout and register functionality
Global state configuration is not used since it is simple app, but redux could be utilized to make things easier

Haven't integrated the google authentication yet, and forget password options since they require some form of email verrification
Profile is lacking since it only contains blogs and email
Feedback from backend is not implemented totally.
